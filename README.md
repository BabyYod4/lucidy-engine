This is a personal effort to create a simulation engine in modern C++ code targeted at scientists without any programming experience. 

In the frist stages of the engine I will primarly focus on supporting OpenGL 4.1 Core, but in the future i will switch to another API like Vulkan if the graphics API is becoming the bottle neck of the simulations ran. 

Another big feature that i want to add is the ability to mix up a fast computing library like CUDA with this engine that handles most of the physics based calculations. 

The engine is completely opensource and can be modified to your hand content. I real don't care what you do with it. 

Currently i am still in the desicsion phase where i am experimenting with different API's and libraries to see what i want to use, but in the holiday's (Starting in July) i will begin on the serious development of the simulation engine. 

Please keep in mind that this wont be a simple physics based simulation engine where you can interact with 3D objects, but will allow for more advanched simulations like detecting stress and weakpoint in joint from 3D objects, simulating weather corrosion of 3D objects made from specifc aloys, pressure testing from outside or inside forces, fluid movement and much more. 

The scripting language will be somthing similar to Latex, named LY-TX where a scientist can write generic looking formula's which are translated to C++ code and ran in the simulation. 

The development of this engine will be documented in a book and online tutorials which can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LIByiO3rSoQcDVwfGk8Qg?view_as=subscriber).
